Hi! My name is Dmitry Nasedkin, but you may know me by my online handle — YutaRedux.  

I write code that solves problems.  

I specialize in complex, high-throughput applications for social media marketing, promotion automation and business analytics.
UI/UX is my number one priority: I make *tools*, not fidget toys. 

**Tech stack: Go (main language), Dart/Flutter, C++, Python.**  
My strongest area of expertise is concurrency and obsessive optimization. I write highly concurrent code ready for scale from day one.  
I'm also proficient at desktop application development with platform-specific features like named pipes, FFI, l8n/i10n and custom protocols.  

Notable projects:
- [**Skyline:**](https://github.com/miraclebots-dev/skyline) open-source licensing server for commercial software. Best-in-class encryption, crack-resistant protocol, telemetry collection and analysis, product-agnostic.
- [**vkmax:**](https://github.com/nsdkinx/vkmax) Python client library for the MAX messenger.
*... to be filled...*

I'm also a passionate digital minimalist, law student, UI/UX and motion designer, self-improvement enthusiast, interested in philosophy and ancient mythology, and have a shit ton of other hyperfixations — pick one.

I am strictly anti-AI. There is zero AI-generated code under my name. I don't outsource my thinking to random text generators.  
If AI-generated content is a requirement for your project, I'm not the right fit.
